      <span>Albert Einstein</span> was the embodiment of pure intellect, the bumbling professor with the German accent,
      a
      comic cliche in a thousand films. Instantly recognizable, like Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp, Albert
      Einstein's shaggy-haired visage was as familiar to ordinary people as to the matrons who fluttered about
      him in salons from Berlin to Hollywood. Yet he was unfathomably profound — the genius among geniuses
      who discovered, merely by thinking about it, that the universe was not as it seemed.
      Even now scientists marvel at the daring of general relativity ("I still can't see how he thought of it," said
      the late Richard Feynman, no slouch himself). But the great physicist was also engagingly simple, trading
      ties and socks for mothy sweaters and sweatshirts. He tossed off pithy aphorisms ("Science is a wonderful
      thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it") and playful doggerel as easily as equations. Viewing the
      hoopla over him with humorous detachment, he variously referred to himself as the Jewish saint or artist's
      model. He was a cartoonist's dream come true

      <span>William (Bill) H. Gates</span> is chairman of Microsoft Corporation, the worldwide leader in software,
      services and
      solutions that help people and businesses realize their full potential.
      Born on Oct. 28, 1955, Gates grew up in Seattle with his two sisters. Their father, William H. Gates II, is a
      Seattle attorney.
      Their late mother, Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and chairwoman of United Way
      International. Gates attended public elementary school and the private Lakeside School. There, he discovered his
      interest
      in software and began programming computers at age 13.
      In 1973, Gates entered Harvard University as a freshman, where he lived down the hall from Steve Ballmer, now
      Microsoft's chief executive officer. While at Harvard, Gates developed a version of the programming language BASIC
      for
      the first microcomputer - the MITS Altair. In his junior year, Gates left Harvard to devote his energies to
      Microsoft, a
      company he had begun in 1975 with his childhood friend Paul Allen. Guided by a belief that the computer would be a
      valuable tool on every office desktop and in every home, they began developing software for personal computers.
      Gates'
      foresight and his vision for personal computing have been central to the success of Microsoft and the software
      industry.

      <span>Adolf Hitler</span> was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau-am-Inn on the Austrian-German border. His father
      was a
      customs official. Hitler left school at 16 with no qualifications and struggled to make a living as a painter in
      Vienna. This was where many of his extreme political and racial ideas originated.
      In 1913, he moved to Munich and, on the outbreak of World War One, enlisted in the German army, where he was
      wounded and decorated. In 1919, he joined the fascist German Workers' Party (DAP). He played to the
      resentments of right-wingers, promising extremist 'remedies' to Germany's post-war problems which he and many
      others blamed on Jews and Bolsheviks. By 1921 he was the unquestioned leader of what was now the National
      Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP or Nazi Party).
      In 1923, Hitler attempted an unsuccessful armed uprising in Munich and was imprisoned for nine months, during
      which time he dictated his book 'Mein Kampf' outlining his political ideology. On his release he began to rebuild
      the Nazi Party and used new techniques of mass communication, backed up with violence, to get his message
      across. Against a background of economic depression and political turmoil, the Nazis grew stronger and in the
      1932 elections became the largest party in the German parliament. In January 1933, Hitler became chancellor
      of a coalition government. He quickly took dictatorial powers and began to institute anti-Jewish laws. He also
      began the process of German militarisation and territorial expansion that would eventually lead to World War
      Two. He allied with Italy and later Japan to create the Axis
